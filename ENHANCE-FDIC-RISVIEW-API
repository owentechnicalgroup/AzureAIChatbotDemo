## FEATURE:

- The goal of this feature is to add a new tool that will allow the AI Agent to lookup Financial Information about a bank using the FDIC RISView API. This is the /banks/fincancials node documented in the API
- The FDIC RISView provides types of data, Instiution Identifiers, Financial Metrics, Classifications Flags and Regulatory and Statistical Code.
- You should instruct the agent to use the FDIC RISView API when:
- You need current or historical financial metrics for a bank or group of banks.
- You are analyzing total assets, domestic deposits, or capital ratios.
- You are evaluating community bank status, multi-state operations, or branch presence.
- You are comparing institutions based on deposit concentration, liquidity, or geographic footprint.
- You are conducting regional or metro-level analysis using CBSA codes or names.
- You should instruct the agent to not use the FDIC RISView API when:
- Tracking institutional changes like mergers, closures, or name changes (use the FDIC History API instead).
- Retrieving consumer complaint data or enforcement actions (use appropriate CFPB or OCC sources).
- The API should use the API Key used by the other FDIC search.
- Enhance the bank_analysis_tool to use data from the FDIC RISView API instead of MOC data from the call_report_data_tool.
- Keep the call_report_data_tool, but remove it from the bank_analysis_tool
