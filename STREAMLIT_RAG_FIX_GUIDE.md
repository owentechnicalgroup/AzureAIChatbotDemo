# Streamlit RAG Integration Fix Guide

## Problem Identified

The Streamlit application was not using RAG correctly because:

1. **Dynamic tool loader not loading tools** - The service availability checker wasn't working properly
2. **LangChainToolRegistry using old RAG components** - Trying to import deprecated components
3. **RAG tool not properly integrated** - The separated architecture tools weren't being loaded

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Fixed Streamlit App

**File: `src/ui/streamlit_app_fixed.py`**

This version:
- ✅ **Directly creates RAG tool** using `DocumentSearchTool` from separated architecture
- ✅ **Uses working document management** with `ChromaDBManager` and `DocumentProcessor`  
- ✅ **Explicitly loads tools** into ChatbotAgent instead of relying on dynamic loading
- ✅ **Shows tool status prominently** so users can see if RAG is working
- ✅ **Includes RAG testing** with a test button to verify functionality

### 2. Fixed Core Issues

**RAG Tool Integration:**
- Fixed Pydantic field conflicts in `DocumentSearchTool`
- Ensured `is_available` property returns proper boolean
- Added proper property accessors for internal components

**ChatbotAgent Integration:**
- Verified agent accepts tools through dependency injection
- Confirmed multi-step mode works with RAG tools
- Tested end-to-end RAG responses

### 3. Test Results

✅ **RAG tool creation works**  
✅ **RAG tool reports as available: True**  
✅ **ChatbotAgent loads with 1 tool**  
✅ **Agent uses multi-step mode (RAG active)**  
✅ **Generates proper responses**  

## Usage Instructions

### Run the Fixed Streamlit App

```bash
cd "C:\Users\owenm\OneDrive - Mo Knows Tech\context-engineering-intro"
streamlit run src/ui/streamlit_app_fixed.py
```

### Key Features in Fixed App

1. **Tool Status Dashboard** - Shows if RAG and banking tools are available
2. **RAG Test Button** - Tests RAG tool directly to verify functionality  
3. **Document Management** - Upload and manage documents for RAG
4. **Multi-step Chat** - Agent uses RAG tool when relevant documents are available

### Verify RAG is Working

1. **Check Tool Status** - Green checkmarks should show RAG tool available
2. **Upload Documents** - Add PDF, DOCX, or TXT files
3. **Ask Document Questions** - Ask "What documents are available?" or specific questions about uploaded content
4. **Look for Multi-step Mode** - Responses should show "Used tools to answer your question"

## Technical Details

### RAG Architecture Flow

```
User Query → ChatbotAgent → DocumentSearchTool → SearchService → DatabaseManager → ChromaDB
                                                      ↓
User Response ← ChatbotAgent ← DocumentSearchTool ← RAG Response ← Vector Search ← Documents
```

### Key Components Working

- **DocumentSearchTool** - LangChain tool interface using separated architecture
- **SearchService** - AI search and response generation with Azure OpenAI
- **DatabaseManager** - ChromaDB interface with persistent storage
- **ChatbotAgent** - Multi-step agent executor with tool orchestration

### Configuration Requirements

All properly configured via Azure Key Vault:
- ✅ `azure_openai_endpoint` - Azure OpenAI service endpoint
- ✅ `azure_openai_api_key` - API key for authentication  
- ✅ `azure_openai_deployment` - GPT-4 deployment for chat completions
- ✅ `azure_embedding_deployment` - Embedding model for document vectors
- ✅ `chromadb_storage_path` - Local ChromaDB storage directory

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before (Broken)
- Dynamic tool loading failed silently
- RAG tool not available to agent
- Agent responses used simple mode only
- No way to verify if RAG was working
- Users couldn't tell why document questions weren't answered

### After (Fixed)
- Direct tool creation with error visibility
- RAG tool explicitly available to agent  
- Agent responses use multi-step mode with tools
- Clear tool status dashboard
- Test functionality to verify RAG operation
- Users can see when tools are used

## Future Improvements

1. **Fix Dynamic Tool Loading** - Repair the service availability checker
2. **Update Original Streamlit App** - Apply fixes to existing app
3. **Add More RAG Features** - Query refinement, source attribution, etc.
4. **Monitoring & Analytics** - Track RAG usage and effectiveness

The fixed Streamlit app demonstrates that the separated RAG architecture is working correctly. The issue was in the tool loading and integration, not in the core RAG functionality.
