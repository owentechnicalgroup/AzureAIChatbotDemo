### üîÑ Project Awareness & Context
- **Always read `PLANNING.md`** at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints.
- **Check `TASK.md`** before starting a new task. If the task isn‚Äôt listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
- **Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns** as described in `PLANNING.md`.
- **Use venv_linux** (the virtual environment) whenever executing Python commands, including for unit tests.

### üß± Code Structure & Modularity
- **Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code.** If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility.
- **Follow the current modular architecture:**
  - `src/main.py` - Main entry point supporting both CLI and Streamlit interfaces
  - `src/chatbot/` - ChatbotAgent implementation with flexible knowledge modes
  - `src/document_management/` - RAG system with ChromaDB integration
  - `src/rag_access/` - RAG search services and retrieval tools
  - `src/tools/` - Modular tool system:
    - `atomic/` - Single-purpose tools (RAG search, banking lookups)
    - `composite/` - Multi-step analysis tools
    - `infrastructure/` - API clients and service integrations
  - `src/ui/` - Streamlit web interface
  - `src/services/` - Core services (logging, response formatting)
- **Use clear, consistent imports** (prefer relative imports within packages).
- **Use python_dotenv and load_env()** for environment variables.

### Technical Architecture
- **langchain-openai** for Azure OpenAI integration
- **azure-identity** for authentication
- **structlog** for JSON logging with OpenTelemetry integration
- **python-dotenv** for configuration management
- **click** for CLI interface
- **rich** for enhanced console output
- **streamlit** for primary web interface
- **chromadb** for vector storage and RAG functionality
- **pypdf** and **python-docx** for document processing
- **pydantic** for data validation and settings management
- **azure-monitor-opentelemetry** for modern telemetry collection

### üìö RAG & Document Management
- **Use the separated RAG architecture** with clear component boundaries:
  - `DocumentManager` for high-level document operations and lifecycle management
  - `ChromaDBService` for vector storage and similarity search
  - `DocumentProcessor` for file parsing and text chunking
  - `DatabaseManager` for metadata storage and relationship management
- **Document processing supports** PDF, DOCX, TXT, and Markdown files
- **RAG modes**: Implement both document-only and hybrid (document + general knowledge) modes
- **Performance targets**: Keep ChromaDB vector search under 2 seconds response time
- **Document storage**: Use persistent `data/chromadb/` directory for document persistence

### üîß Tool System Architecture
- **Follow the three-tier tool organization:**
  - **Atomic Tools**: Single-purpose tools in `tools/atomic/` (e.g., RAG search, banking lookups)
  - **Composite Tools**: Multi-step analysis tools in `tools/composite/` (e.g., bank analysis)
  - **Infrastructure**: API clients and integrations in `tools/infrastructure/`
- **Use the categorization system** from `tools/categories.py` for tool classification:
  - `ToolCategory.DOCUMENTS` - RAG and document processing tools
  - `ToolCategory.BANKING` - Financial and call report tools
  - `ToolCategory.ANALYSIS` - Data analysis and computation tools
  - `ToolCategory.WEB` - Web search and external API tools
  - `ToolCategory.UTILITIES` - General utility tools
- **Implement dynamic tool loading** based on service availability
- **Add category metadata** to tools using `add_category_metadata()` function

### üñ•Ô∏è Interface Guidelines
- **Streamlit is the primary interface** - most new features should support the web UI
- **CLI interface is secondary** - maintain compatibility but Streamlit takes priority
- **Shared ChatbotAgent** - ensure consistent behavior across both interfaces
- **User-controlled knowledge modes** - allow users to toggle between document-only and hybrid modes
- **Document management UI** - provide intuitive upload, delete, and management interfaces

### üöÄ Environment Setup & Configuration
- **Always update `.\scripts\setup-env.ps1`** when adding new environment variables to the application.
- **Environment variables must be added in 3 places:**
  1. `infrastructure/outputs.tf` - Add to the `environment_variables` output section
  2. `scripts/setup-env.ps1` - Add to the `New-EnvContent` function with proper documentation
  3. `src/config/settings.py` - Add as pydantic settings fields with proper types and defaults
- **The setup-env.ps1 script** extracts Terraform outputs and generates the `.env` file automatically.
- **Never manually edit the generated `.env` file** - it gets overwritten by the setup script.

### üîç Logging Standards
- **Use the dual observability system** with both traditional logging and OpenTelemetry integration
- **All logs must include a `log_type` property** at the top level (not in customDimensions) for Azure Log Analytics categorization.
- **Use these 5 standardized log_type values:**
  - `CONVERSATION` - Chat interactions, message processing, conversation flow
  - `AZURE_OPENAI` - Azure OpenAI API calls, responses, token usage
  - `PERFORMANCE` - Response times, throughput metrics, resource usage
  - `SECURITY` - Authentication, Key Vault operations, credential management
  - `SYSTEM` - Application lifecycle, configuration, health checks, errors
- **Add log_type when creating loggers**: `logger.bind(log_type="CATEGORY")`
- **Use structured logging helpers** in `utils/logging_helpers.py` which automatically set appropriate log_type values
- **OpenTelemetry integration**: The system supports modern telemetry collection through `azure-monitor-opentelemetry`
- **Graceful fallback**: If dual observability fails to initialize, the system falls back to legacy logging

### üß™ Testing & Reliability
- **Always create Pytest unit tests for new features** (functions, classes, routes, etc).
- **After updating any logic**, check whether existing unit tests need to be updated. If so, do it.
- **Tests should live in a `/tests` folder** mirroring the main app structure.
  - Include at least:
    - 1 test for expected use
    - 1 edge case
    - 1 failure case

### ‚úÖ Task Completion
- **Mark completed tasks in `TASK.md`** immediately after finishing them.
- Add new sub-tasks or TODOs discovered during development to `TASK.md` under a ‚ÄúDiscovered During Work‚Äù section.

### üìé Style & Conventions
- **Use Python** as the primary language.
- **Follow PEP8**, use type hints, and format with `black`.
- **Use `pydantic` for data validation** and settings management.
- **LangChain compatibility**: Ensure all tools extend `BaseTool` and work with LangChain agents
- **Streamlit best practices**: Use session state for persistence, implement proper error handling
- **ChromaDB patterns**: Use async/await for database operations, implement proper connection management
- Write **docstrings for every function** using the Google style:
  ```python
  def example():
      """
      Brief summary.

      Args:
          param1 (type): Description.

      Returns:
          type: Description.
      """
  ```

### üìö Documentation & Explainability
- **Update `README.md`** when new features are added, dependencies change, or setup steps are modified.
- **Comment non-obvious code** and ensure everything is understandable to a mid-level developer.
- When writing complex logic, **add an inline `# Reason:` comment** explaining the why, not just the what.

### üß† AI Behavior Rules
- **Never assume missing context. Ask questions if uncertain.**
- **Never hallucinate libraries or functions** ‚Äì only use known, verified Python packages.
- **Always confirm file paths and module names** exist before referencing them in code or tests.
- **Never delete or overwrite existing code** unless explicitly instructed to or if part of a task from `TASK.md`.
